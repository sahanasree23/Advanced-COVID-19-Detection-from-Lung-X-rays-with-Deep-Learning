1. Layers and Models in TensorFlow and Keras:
    - Dense, Flatten, Input: Fundamental Keras layers used to build the architecture of a neural network.
    - Model: The Keras Model class is used to define a model by specifying its input and output layers.

2. Utilities in TensorFlow and Keras:
    - image: This submodule within `tensorflow.keras.preprocessing` provides tools for handling image data.
    - ImageDataGenerator: Facilitates the generation of batches of augmented or normalized data from image files.
    - load_img: A function from `tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image` to load an image file into a PIL image object.

3. Pre-trained Models:
    - InceptionV3, Xception, ResNet, VGG16: These are pre-trained deep learning models available in Keras Applications, which can be utilized for base modeling or transfer learning.
    - preprocess_input: Functions from the respective model modules that preprocess input images to be compatible with these models.

4. File Handling and Utilities:
    - glob: Utilized for file handling, `glob.glob()` retrieves files or pathnames that match a specific pattern.

5. Numerical and Plotting Libraries:
    - numpy: A key package for scientific computing in Python, offering support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with various mathematical functions.
    - matplotlib.pyplot: A Python library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

6. Flask:
    - A web framework used for developing web applications.
